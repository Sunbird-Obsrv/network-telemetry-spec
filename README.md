# Network Telemetry Specefication

## Introduction

In the realm of Open Networks, telemetry (along with the resultant data) offers numerous advantages and values to both the network itself and its participants. The collected telemetry is expected to yield a wealth of insights, actions, and features related to aspects such as network health, economics, equitable usage, user experience, regulatory compliance, detection of frauds and anomalies, market dynamics, business operations, public transparency, open data, and various other dimensions.

This specification proposes a standardized telemetry specification for open, decentralized networks/protocols to enable network observability.
