# Telemetry Specification

The telemetry specification proposal aims to capture the ideal quantity and level of detail from the network, ensuring that the network's desired value is delivered without jeopardizing the privacy or business interests of any of its participants.

This specification document for the open networks telemetry contains the following sections:

- **Telemetry Events** - List of all telemetry events and their corresponding OpenTelemetry signals that are part of the spec
- **Telemetry Envelope** - A standardized common envelope for all telemetry events that encompass the “context” of the event
- **Event Definitions** - Detailed definition of every event along with examples
- **Reference Implementation Design** - A reference design for implementing network observability across network participants and the network facilitator

## Telemetry Events

In alignment with the design principles outlined above, the telemetry specification for open networks mandates two categories of data to be generated by all network participants:

- **API Transactions Data** -  Information regarding all API calls, encompassing transport detail, contextual information, and operational details such as response time and status codes, will be valuable for monitoring and analyzing network health. 
And this data also facilitates various other capabilities for network observability, such as:
  - Traceability within the network
  - Network Infra Health
  - Participant Infra Health
  - Correlation between Network participants
  - Network and NP level usage metrics

- **Business & Operational Metrics** - Aggregated metrics related to the business and operational activities of a network participant will assist the network in generating and sharing data and insights regarding network performance, market trends, and other relevant aspects to all stakeholders.
  The specific set of metrics to be produced will differ for each network, and the network must publish the metrics list through a metrics registry. A primary guiding principle in metrics design is to avoid capturing any business-sensitive or private data belonging to a network participant or individual.

In addition to the above two mandatory data points, the specification also includes an optional data that a Network Participant can generate:

- **Audit Information** - Audit information such as changes in a workflow status or business audit events will facilitate numerous network participant-specific scenarios, such as compliance checks, handling grievances, adhering to SLAs, and assessing quality metrics.
  Furthermore, this data will also support business auditing for a network participant across various dimensions, including:
  - SLA Monitoring
  - Status Monitoring
  - Participant Quality Metrics
  - Auditing and Debugging
  - Grievances and Compliance

Following are the list of open telemetry signals a network participant has to generate for the above mentioned telemetry data:

- **TRACE** - Record API transaction events as a TRACE signal, which internally comprises a collection of SPANS, as per the OpenTelemetry protocol.
- **METRIC** - Capture the business & operational metrics as the Open Telemetry’s METRIC signal. 
- **LOG** - Collect all the audit logs within a network participant using the LOG signal.
